-- 1. Create a CTE to calculate service statistics, then query from it.

    SELECT 
        sw.service,
        SUM(sw.patients_admitted) AS total_admitted,
        SUM(sw.patients_refused) AS total_refused,

        ROUND(AVG(sw.staff_morale),2) AS avg_staff_morale
    FROM services_weekly sw
    GROUP BY sw.service
)
SELECT *
FROM service_stats;


-- 2. Use multiple CTEs to break down a complex query into logical steps.

        AVG(total_admitted) AS avg_admitted
    FROM service_totals

    st.service,
    st.total_admitted,
    st.total_admitted - oa.avg_admitted AS diff_from_avg,
    CASE
        WHEN st.total_admitted > oa.avg_admitted THEN 'Above Average'
        WHEN st.total_admitted = oa.avg_admitted THEN 'Average'
        ELSE 'Below Average'
    END AS rank_indicator
FROM service_totals st
JOIN overall_avg oa
ORDER BY st.total_admitted DESC;


-- 3. Build a CTE for staff utilization and join it with patient data.


-- Daily Challenge  
/*Create a comprehensive hospital performance dashboard using CTEs. Calculate: 
1) Service-level metrics (total admissions, refusals, avg satisfaction), 
2) Staff metrics per service (total staff, avg weeks present), 
3) Patient demographics per service (avg age, count). 
Then combine all three CTEs to create a final report showing service name, all calculated metrics, 
and an overall performance score (weighted average of admission rate and satisfaction). Order by performance score descending. */
